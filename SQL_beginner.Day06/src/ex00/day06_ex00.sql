-- Letâ€™s expand our data model to involve a new business feature.
-- Every person wants to see a personal discount and every business wants to be closer for clients.
--
-- Please think about personal discounts for people from one side and pizzeria restaurants from other. Need to create a new relational table
-- (please set a name `person_discounts`) with the next rules.
-- - set id attribute like a Primary Key (please take a look on id column in existing tables and choose the same data type)
-- - set for attributes person_id and pizzeria_id foreign keys for corresponding tables (data types should be the same like for id columns in
--   corresponding parent tables)
-- - please set explicit names for foreign keys constraints by pattern fk_{table_name}_{column_name},  for example `fk_person_discounts_person_id`
-- - add a discount attribute to store a value of discount in percent. Remember, discount value can be a number with floats (please just use `numeric` data type).
--   So, please choose the corresponding data type to cover this possibility.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS person_discounts(
  id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
  person_id BIGINT,
  pizzeria_id BIGINT,
  discount NUMERIC,
  CONSTRAINT fk_person_discounts_person_id FOREIGN KEY (person_id) REFERENCES person(id),
  CONSTRAINT fk_person_discounts_pizzeria_id FOREIGN KEY (pizzeria_id) REFERENCES pizzeria(id)
);
