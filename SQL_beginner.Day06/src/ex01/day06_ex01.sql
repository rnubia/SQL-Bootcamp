-- Actually, we created a structure to store our discounts and we are ready to go further and fill our `person_discounts` table with new records.
--
-- So, there is a table `person_order` that stores the history of a person's orders. Please write a DML statement (`INSERT INTO ... SELECT ...`)
-- that makes  inserts new records into `person_discounts` table based on the next rules.
-- - take aggregated state by person_id and pizzeria_id columns
-- - calculate personal discount value by the next pseudo code:
--
--     `if “amount of orders” = 1 then
--         “discount” = 10.5
--     else if “amount of orders” = 2 then
--         “discount” = 22
--     else
--         “discount” = 30`
--
-- - to generate a primary key for the person_discounts table please use  SQL construction below (this construction is from the WINDOW FUNCTION  SQL area).
--
--     `... ROW_NUMBER( ) OVER ( ) AS id ...`
--

INSERT INTO person_discounts(id, person_id, pizzeria_id, discount)
SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER() AS id,
  person_id, pizzeria_id,
  CASE
    WHEN COUNT(person_id) = 1 THEN 10.5
    WHEN COUNT(person_id) = 2 THEN 22
    ELSE 30
  END AS discount
FROM person_order
  JOIN menu
  ON person_order.menu_id = menu.id
GROUP BY person_id, pizzeria_id;
